Hello and welcome to my project "US bikeshare"

it was really tricky and challenging going through the project especially the part of the Pandas library

1- My brother is 7 years of experience in web development and he's a 
senior RPA and business analysis  and he helped me a lot with the project
by giving me too many suggestions and thoughts to do especially with repeating the questions

2- "weekday_name" in pandas library didn't work the first time, so I searched on "Stack flow" and
I have modified it to be "day_name()"

3- I were stuck in the frequent combination between the Start and End stations, but i also searched on "Pandas website" and 
"keytodosience.com", i settled on type it like '.mode()'.

Thanks alot for the opportunity in this scholarship
